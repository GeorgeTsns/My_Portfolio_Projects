This project involves the analysis of a case study as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate program on Coursera. The case study centers around Cyclistic Bike-Share, a fictional company, and aims to address crucial business inquiries. Specifically, the objective is to optimize the annual membership base. To achieve this goal, we are tasked with examining the distinct usage patterns of two customer types within the company: Subscribers, who acquire annual memberships, and Casual Riders, who opt for single-ride or full-day passes. The analysis will shed light on how these customer segments differ in their utilization of Cyclistic bikes.
