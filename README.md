This is a Case-study analysis project, for a fictional Cyclistic Bike-Share company, where we have to answer key business questions. The goal is to maximize the annual members of the current company,
so we need to find out how those two different types of customers, which are the Subscribers(customers who
purchase annual memberships and the casual riders(who purchase single-ride or full-day passes), use Cyclistic bikes differently.
